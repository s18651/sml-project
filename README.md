### Implementation of World CO2 Emissions Analysis with Python and Machine Learning using Flask and Scikit-Learn for PJAIT course SML

<br /><br />

## Functionalities
<hr>

1. [x] CO2 statistics and predictions for Poland
2. [x] CO2 statistics for any country
3. [ ] CO2 statistics and predictions per continent
4. [x] Random environment and economic news (partly automatically translated)
5. [x] Showing differences between years for CO2 emission for any country
6. [ ] Possibility of CO2 emission comparison between countries

<br /><br />

## Future ideas
<hr>

1. CO2 predictions for the world based on 50 environment and ecomonic indicators

<br /><br />
