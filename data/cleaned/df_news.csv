The agriculture sector is the most water-intensive sector, and water delivery in agriculture is increasingly important.
Data on irrigated agricultural land and data on average precipitation illustrate how countries obtain water for agricultural use. Private financial flows - equity and debt - account for the bulk of development finance.
Equity flows comprise foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio equity.
Debt flows are financing raised through bond issuance, bank lending, and supplier credits. The balance of payments records an economy's transactions with the rest of the world.
Balance of payments accounts are divided into two groups: the current account, which records transactions in goods, services, income, and current transfers, and the capital and financial account, which records capital transfers, acquisition or disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets, and transactions in financial assets and liabilities. Expenditure on research and development (R&D) is a key indicator of government and private sector efforts to obtain competitive advantage in science and technology. Statistical Capacity is a nation’s ability to collect, analyze, and disseminate high-quality data about its population and economy.
Quality statistics are essential for all stages of evidence-based decision-making, including: Monitoring social and economic indicators, Allocating political representation and government resources, Guiding private sector investment, as well as Informing the international donor community for program design and policy formulation. Because development encompasses many factors - economic, environmental, cultural, educational, and institutional - no single measure gives a complete picture.
However, the total earnings of the residents of an economy, measured by its gross national income (GNI), is a good measure of its capacity to provide for the well-being of its people. In a market-based economy, household, producer, and government choices about resource allocation are influenced by relative prices, including the real exchange rate, real wages, real interest rates, and other prices in the economy.
Relative prices also largely reflect these agents' choices.
Thus relative prices convey vital information about the interaction of economic agents in an economy and with the rest of the world. The Gender Parity Index (GPI) indicates parity between girls and boys.
A GPI of less than 1 suggests girls are more disadvantaged than boys in learning opportunities and a GPI of greater than 1 suggests the other way around.
Eliminating gender disparities in education would help increase the status and capabilities of women. The pupil-teacher ratio is often used to compare the quality of schooling across countries, but it is often weakly related to student learning and quality of education. The World Bank and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics jointly developed the primary completion rate indicator.
Increasingly used as a core indicator of an education system's performance, it reflects an education system's coverage and the educational attainment of students. A relative high concentration of the adult population in a given level of education reflects the capacity of the educational system in the corresponding level of education.
Educational attainment is closely related to the skills and competencies of a country's population, and could be seen as a proxy of both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the stock of human capital. The share of girls allows an assessment on gender composition in school enrollment.
A value greater than 50% indicates participation of more girls at a specific level or programme of education. The net intake rate in the first grade of primary education indicates the level of access to primary education and the education system's capacity to provide access to primary education.
A high net intake rate indicates a high degree of access to primary education for the official primary school entrance age children. The cohort survival rate measures an education system's holding power and internal efficiency.
Rates approaching 100 percent indicate high retention and low dropout levels. Data on repeaters are often used to indicate an education system's internal efficiency.
Repeaters not only increase the cost of education for the family and the school system, but also use limited school resources. Women teachers are important as they serve as role models to girls and help to attract and retain girls in school. The share of female teachers shows the level of gender representation in the teaching force.
A value of greater than 50% indicates more opportunities or preference for women to participate in teaching activities.
Women teachers are important as they serve as role models to girls and help to attract and retain girls in school. Relevance to gender indicator: Women teachers are important as they serve as role models to girls and help to attract and retain girls in school. Large numbers of children out of school create pressure to enroll children and provide classrooms, teachers, and educational materials, a task made difficult in many countries by limited education budgets.
However, getting children into school is a high priority for countries and crucial for achieving universal primary education. The share of government expenditure for a specific education level allows an assessment of the priority a government assigns to a level of education relative to other levels.
Enrolment and the relative costs per student between different levels of education should be also taken into account. The share of government expenditure devoted to education allows an assessment of the priority a government assigns to education relative to other public investments, as well as a government's commitment to investing in human capital development.
Countries with younger populations may spend more on education in relation to other sector such as health or social security, and vice-versa. The percentage of government expenditure on education to GDP is useful to compare education expenditure between countries and/or over time in relation to the size of their economy; A high percentage to GDP suggests a high priority for education and a capacity of raising revenues for public spending.
Note that government expenditure appears lower in some countries where the private sector and/or households have a large share in total funding for education. Women‘s participation in decisions being made in their own households, that is households in which they usually live with their spouse and/or children with or without others, is widely accepted as a universal indicator of women‘s empowerment.
The ability of women to make decisions that affect their personal circumstances is an essential element of their empowerment and serves as an important contributor to their overall development. Women often spend disproportionately more time on unpaid domestic and care work than men.
This unequal division of responsibilities is correlated with gender differences in economic opportunities, includign low female labor force participation, occupational sex segregation, and earnings diffrentials.
The need for a gender balance in the distribution of unpaid domestic and care work has been increasingly recognized and the Sustainable Development Goals address the issue in the target 5. 4. Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, adolescents, youth and adults) and overall mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country.
Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations.
And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.

And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries. Despite the existence of effective medications and treatment, HIV/AIDS is still a leading cause of death and public health threat in the world.
Low and middle income countries continue to bear a disproportionate share of the global burden of HIV/AIDS.
The incidence rate provides a measure of progress toward preventing onward transmission of HIV.
Also, the identification of newly infected persons will allow for interventions to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, and ??is an essential component for reducing under-five mortality.
Immunization coverage estimates are used to monitor coverage of immunization services and to guide disease eradication and elimination efforts. The WHO estimates that at least 2. 5 medical staff (physicians, nurses and midwives) per 1,000 people are needed to provide adequate coverage with primary care interventions (WHO, World Health Report 2006). Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental risks to health.
According to the World Health Organization, the combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about 7 million premature deaths every year.
Most deaths occur due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.
The majority of the burden is borne by populations in low and middle income countries. Most diarrhea-related deaths are due to dehydration, and many of these deaths can be prevented with the use of oral rehydration salts at home. Mortality rates due to unintentional poisoning remains relatively high in low income countries.
This indicator implicates inadequate management of hazardous chemicals and pollution, and of the effectiveness of a country’s health system. Unsafe drinking water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene are important causes of death.
Most diarrheal deaths in the world are caused by unsafe water, sanitation or hygiene.
According to the World Health Organization, in addition to diarrea, the following diseases could be prevented if adequate WASH services are provided: malnutrition, intestinal nematode infections, lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, schistosomiasis and malaria. The World Bank Group's goal of promoting shared prosperity has been defined as fostering income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the welfare distribution in every country.
Income distribution data and the Gini coefficient measure inequality in income or consumption and important indicators for measuring shared prosperity.

Reducing the cost of remittance transactions has a direct impact on development by freeing additional resources that, instead of being paid as transaction cost, will remain with the senders and receivers of the flows.
Remittance cost is highlighted in Sustainable Development Goal 10.
Target 10. c calls for reducing to less than 3 percent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and ensure that in no corridor remittance senders are required to pay more than 5 percent by 2030. In most countries more boys are involved in employment, or the gender difference is small.
However, girls are often more present in hidden or underreported forms of employment such as domestic service, and in almost all societies girls bear greater responsibility for household chores in their own homes, work that lies outside the System of National Accounts production boundary and is thus not considered in estimates of children's employment. The indicator provides information on the proportion of women who are employed in decision-making and management roles in government, large enterprises and institutions. Good nutrition is the cornerstone for survival, health and development.
Well-nourished children perform better in school, grow into healthy adults and in turn give their children a better start in life.
Well-nourished women face fewer risks during pregnancy and childbirth, and their children set off on firmer developmental paths, both physically and mentally (UNICEF www. childinfo. org). The crude mortality rate is a good indicator of the general health status of a geographic area or population.
The crude death rate is not appropriate for comparison of different populations or areas with large differences in age-distributions.
Higher crude death rates can be found in some developed countries, despite high life expectancy, because typically these countries have a much higher proportion of older people, due to lower recent birth rates and lower age-specific mortality rates. Reproductive health is a state of physical and mental well-being in relation to the reproductive system and its functions and processes.
Means of achieving reproductive health include education and services during pregnancy and childbirth, safe and effective contraception, and prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.
Complications of pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries. Patterns of development in a country are partly determined by the age composition of its population.
Different age groups have different impacts on both the environment and on infrastructure needs.
Therefore the age structure of a population is useful for analyzing resource use and formulating future policy and planning goals with regards infrastructure and development. Females comprise almost one-half of the world population.
Female population relative to male population is a primary demographic indicator, reflecting historical events such as wars and the socio-demographic and ethno-cultural characteristics of the population. Explosive growth of cities globally signifies the demographic transition from rural to urban, and is associated with shifts from an agriculture-based economy to mass industry, technology, and service. 

In principle, cities offer a more favorable setting for the resolution of social and environmental problems than rural areas.
Cities generate jobs and income, and deliver education, health care and other services.
Cities also present opportunities for social mobilization and women's empowerment. Trade in services differs from trade in goods because services are produced and consumed at the same time.
Thus services to a traveler may be consumed in the producing country (for example, use of a hotel room) but are classified as imports of the traveler's country.
In other cases services may be supplied from a remote location; for example, insurance services may be supplied from one location and consumed in another. Low- and middle-income economies are an increasingly important part of the global trading system.
Trade between high-income economies and low- and middle-income economies has grown faster than trade between high-income economies.
This increased trade benefits both producers and consumers in developing and high-income economies. Although global integration has increased, low- and middle-income economies still face trade barriers when accessing other markets.
